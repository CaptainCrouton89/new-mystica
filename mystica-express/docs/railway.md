# Railway Deployment Configuration

The Railway app has all variables from @.env.local loaded (but NODE_ENV=production). The Railway app is connected to the monorepo git repo.

The node engine is 24 (well supported as of October 2025).

## Configuration Files

- **railway.toml** - Root-level Railway configuration
  - `builder = "DOCKERFILE"` - Use Dockerfile for builds
  - `dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"` - Path to Dockerfile relative to rootDirectory
  - `rootDirectory = "mystica-express"` - Set build context to mystica-express/ subdirectory
  - `healthcheckPath = "/api/v1/health"` - Health check endpoint
  - `restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"` - Auto-restart on failure (max 10 retries)
- **Dockerfile** - Located in mystica-express/ directory
  - Node.js 24-slim base image
  - pnpm 8.x (matches lockfile v6.0)
  - Copies package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, tsconfig.json, and src/ from build context
  - Runs TypeScript compilation with `pnpm build`
  - Exposes port 3000, starts with `pnpm start`
- **.dockerignore** - Located in mystica-express/ directory, excludes unnecessary files

## Build Context

Railway uses the monorepo root with `rootDirectory` set to `mystica-express`:
1. Railway starts at monorepo root
2. Reads `railway.toml` which sets `rootDirectory = "mystica-express"`
3. Changes context to `mystica-express/` directory
4. Finds `Dockerfile` at `Dockerfile` (relative to rootDirectory, i.e., `mystica-express/Dockerfile`)
5. Builds with `mystica-express/` as the build context
6. Dockerfile copies files using relative paths (`.` = mystica-express/)

## Local Validation

Test the exact Railway build configuration locally:

```bash
# Navigate to mystica-express directory (Railway's rootDirectory)
cd mystica-express

# Build using local Dockerfile with mystica-express as context
docker build -t mystica-express-test .

# Run with environment variables (Railway provides these via dashboard)
docker run --rm -p 3001:3000 --env-file .env.local mystica-express-test

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
# Expected: {"success":true,"data":{"status":"healthy",...}}
```

This mirrors Railway's build process:
- Build context = `mystica-express/`
- Dockerfile = `mystica-express/Dockerfile`
- Files copied from `mystica-express/` directory

## Production

Production url is `https://mystica-express-production.up.railway.app`

## After Making Fixes

- Don't verify locallyâ€”it takes too long
- commit and push
