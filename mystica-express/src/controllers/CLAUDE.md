Controllers orchestrate HTTP concerns and delegate business logic to services.

## Pattern

Arrow function pattern with middleware error delegation:

```typescript
export class SomeController {
  someAction = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void> => {
    try {
      const { field } = req.body as unknown as SomeRequest;
      const userId = req.user!.id; // Auth middleware ensures user exists
      const result = await service.doSomething(userId, field);
      res.status(201).json(result);
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);  // Middleware handles error mapping
    }
  };
}
```

## Key Patterns

- **Extract:** userId from `req.user!.id`, params/query/body with type casting `as unknown as Type`
- **Delegate:** All business logic to services; never directly query database
- **Respond:** Use `res.json()` or `res.status(code).json()`
- **Errors:** Throw custom errors from `src/utils/errors.ts`; middleware catches

## ItemController Specifics

`ItemController` computes and includes item stats in all item responses (equipment, inventory, loadouts). Stats are computed server-side via `ItemService.computeStats()` to ensure consistency. Always include computed stats in JSON responsesâ€”clients rely on accurate stat data for UI display.

## Type Safety

- Request bodies/query params: Cast as `as unknown as SchemaType` (from `src/types/schemas.ts`)
- Import types from `src/types/schemas.ts` and `src/types/api.types.js`
- No `any` types

## Never

- Database queries directly
- Business logic calculations
- Manual response serialization
- Mix error handling patterns
