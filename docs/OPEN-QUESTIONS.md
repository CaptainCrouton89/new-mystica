## üî• Critical Decisions Needed for MVP1

### 1. Material Stacking Mechanics

**Question:** How do multiple materials combine on a single item?

**Option A: Materials Stack Additively (RECOMMENDED)**
```javascript
Base Sword: {atkPower: 30, defPower: 20}
+ Iron Material: {atkPower: -5, defPower: +5}
+ Flame Material: {atkPower: +10, defPower: -10}
= "Iron Flame Sword": {atkPower: 35, defPower: 15}
```
- ‚úÖ Names concatenate: "Iron Flame Sword"
- ‚úÖ Each material shifts stats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Order matters? Or alphabetical?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need stat modification formula (not simple addition - see note below)

**Option B: Materials Replace (Single Material Only)**
```javascript
Sword ‚Üí Apply Iron ‚Üí "Iron Sword"
Iron Sword ‚Üí Apply Flame ‚Üí "Flame Sword" (iron is gone)
```
- ‚ùå Contradicts "multiple materials can be applied"

**Option C: Limited Stacks (Max 2-3 Materials)**
```javascript
Sword ‚Üí +Iron ‚Üí "Iron Sword"
Iron Sword ‚Üí +Flame ‚Üí "Iron Flame Sword"
Iron Flame Sword ‚Üí +Matcha ‚Üí "Iron Flame Matcha Sword" (MAX)
```
- ‚úÖ Prevents "Iron Flame Matcha Coffee Lightning Shadow Crystal Dragon Sword"
- ‚úÖ Caps complexity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è What's the cap? 2? 3? 5?

**User Note:** "Stat modification might not be quite so simple. Let's log it as an open question."

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Which option? (A or C recommended)
- [ ] If Option C, what's max material count? (Suggest: 3)
- [ ] Material order significance? (alphabetical, application order, or sorted by rarity?)
- [ ] **How exactly do stat modifiers combine?** (additive, multiplicative, diminishing returns, formula TBD)

### 2. Material Drop System

**Question:** How do enemies drop materials to inventory?

**Current Understanding:**
- Enemies drop:
  1. **Gold** (always) - amount scales with enemy level
  2. **Material item** (sometimes) - goes to inventory
     - 95% normal material
     - 5% shiny material (better stats? visual only?)

**Sub-Questions:**

**2a. Material Inventory Management**
- [ ] Can you have multiple of the same material? (5√ó Iron materials in inventory?)
  - **Recommendation:** Yes, stackable (display as "Iron x5")
- [ ] Is there an inventory cap? (Unlimited materials?)
  - **Recommendation:** Start unlimited for MVP1, can add cap later if needed
- [ ] Can you remove/replace materials from items?
  - **Option 1:** Once applied, permanent (simpler)
  - **Option 2:** Can cleanse item back to base (costs gold?)
  - **Option 3:** Can replace material (old one destroyed)

**2b. Shiny Materials**
- [ ] What does shiny material do?
  - **Option 1:** +20% stat modifiers (e.g., normal Iron = +5 DEF, shiny Iron = +6 DEF)
  - **Option 2:** Visual sparkle only (same stats)
  - **Option 3:** Unlocks special visual effects on item (flame particles, glow, etc.)
  - **Recommendation:** Option 1 (+20% stats) for meaningful progression

### 3. Base Item Types & Slots

**Question:** What base item types exist and how do you unlock them?

**Equipment Slots (6 confirmed):**
1. Weapon (sword, wrench, mace, flamethrower, etc.)
2. Head (helmet)
3. Body (armor)
4. Amulet
5. Ring
6. Pet

**For MVP1 Starting Set:**
- 1 weapon type (sword)
- 1 helmet type
- 1 armor type
- 1 amulet type
- 1 ring type
- 1 pet type

**Unlocking Additional Base Types (wrench, mace, flamethrower):**
- [ ] **Option A:** All available from start (simpler, just cosmetic differences)
- [ ] **Option B:** Unlock at vanity level milestones (Level 5 = wrench, Level 10 = mace)
- [ ] **Option C:** Defeat specific bosses (MVP2+ feature)
- [ ] **Option D:** Random rare drop from combat

**Recommendation:** Option A for MVP1 (all types available), save unlocking for MVP2

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] How many base types per slot for MVP1? (1 per slot or multiple?)
- [ ] Do different weapon types have different stats? Or purely cosmetic?
  - **Recommendation:** Same stats for MVP1, purely cosmetic choice

---

### 4. Starting Conditions

**Question:** What does a new player start with?

**Proposed Starting Inventory:**
- [ ] 6 level-1 base items (one per slot, no materials applied)?
- [ ] OR start empty, must collect first items from combat?
- [ ] Starting gold amount? (0? 100? 1000?)
- [ ] Starting materials? (0? Give 1-2 starter materials?)

**Recommendation:**
- Start with 6 level-1 base items (one per slot, no materials)
- 500 starting gold
- 0 starting materials (must earn through combat)
- This ensures immediate combat capability but progression incentive

---

### 5. Material Library Size

**Question:** How many materials for MVP1?

**Options:**
- [ ] **10 materials** - Minimal viable (2 per stat theme)
- [ ] **20 materials** - Moderate variety
- [ ] **50 materials** - High variety

**Material Themes (Examples):**
- Defensive: Iron, Stone, Steel, Diamond
- Offensive: Flame, Lightning, Ice, Shadow
- Balanced: Wood, Copper, Bronze, Silver
- Exotic: Matcha, Coffee, Cosmic, Quantum

**Recommendation:** 20 materials for MVP1 (enough variety without overwhelming)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Exact material count for MVP1
- [ ] Do we pre-generate all materials? Or procedurally generate?
  - **Recommendation:** Pre-generate fixed library for consistency

---

### 6. Enemy Level Scaling

**Question:** How do enemy levels work?

**Option A: Fixed Levels per Location**
- This coffee shop always has Level 3 enemy
- Players choose easier/harder locations
- Requires location tier system

**Option B: Dynamic Scaling to Player**
- Enemy level = average of player's 6 equipped item levels
- OR: average + 1 for slight challenge
- Always appropriately challenging
- No location management needed

**Recommendation:** Option B for MVP1 (simpler, no location tiers)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Which scaling option?
- [ ] If Option B, exact formula? (avg, avg+1, avg*1.1, etc.)

---

### 7. Stat Modification Formula

**Question:** How exactly do material stat modifiers combine?

**User Note:** "For stat modification, it might not be quite so simple."

**Current Unknown:**
- Simple addition might not work (e.g., stacking 10 materials could break balance)
- Need formula for combining multiple modifiers

**Possible Approaches:**

**Option A: Additive with Caps**
```javascript
baseStat + material1Mod + material2Mod + ...
// But cap at +50% / -50% of base
```

**Option B: Multiplicative**
```javascript
baseStat * (1 + material1Mod) * (1 + material2Mod) * ...
// Compounds, harder to predict
```

**Option C: Diminishing Returns**
```javascript
baseStat + material1Mod + (material2Mod * 0.75) + (material3Mod * 0.5) + ...
// Each additional material less impactful
```

**Option D: Custom Formula TBD**
- Define base formula
- Test with sample materials
- Balance iteratively

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] **What formula should we use?**
- [ ] How do we prevent stat stacking from breaking balance?
- [ ] Should there be min/max stat bounds?

## üìã Next Steps

Once these decisions are made:
1. ‚úÖ Update PRD with material system
2. ‚úÖ Revise feature specs (F-03, F-05, F-06)
3. ‚úÖ Update API contracts (new material endpoints)
4. ‚úÖ Update data schemas (materials table, player_items structure)
5. ‚úÖ Update design spec (material application UI)
6. ‚úÖ Create material seed data (JSON for base materials)
7. ‚úÖ Calculate gold costs and drop rates
8. ‚úÖ Define exact stat formulas
