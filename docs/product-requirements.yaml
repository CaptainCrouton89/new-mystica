notes: |
  Core gameplay loop:
  1. Navigate to real-world location using map
  2. Discover location-specific enemy with level = player average item level
  3. Engage in timing-based combat (attack dial + defense dial)
  4. Defeat enemy â†’ receive gold + material drops (60% chance, 5% styled)
  5. Apply materials to base items (max 3 materials per item)
  6. Upgrade items with gold to increase level and stats
  7. Equip stronger items and repeat with harder enemies

  Key differentiators:
  - Tactical combat with skill-based timing (attack AND defense dials)
  - Material-based customization (stack up to 3 materials per item)
  - Normalized stat system (stats sum to 1.0, materials modify by Â±0.1-0.3)
  - Dynamic enemy scaling (always appropriately challenging)
  - Styled materials (visual variants) for collection variety
  - Vanity level progression system (driven by item levels)

  Material System Details:
  - Base items have normalized stats: {atkPower, atkAccuracy, defPower, defAccuracy} sum to 1.0
  - Materials apply modifiers like +0.2 atkPower, -0.1 defSpeed (must sum to 0)
  - Max 3 materials per item (hard limit, absolute maximum)
  - Materials can be removed for gold (100 Ã— item level), returns to stack
  - To replace: remove old material + apply new material (two operations)
  - Styled materials: visual variants with normal stat effectiveness
  - Image generation: 20s sync for MVP, async with crafting times in later MVP
  - Global ItemImageCache stores combo images with craft_count tracking
  - Material Rarity: Auto-classified into strength tiers (common/uncommon/rare/epic) based on stat modifier magnitude (not a stored property)
  - Drop Frequency: Tier-based system controls how often materials drop per location using tier multipliers (common=1.0, epic=0.15)
  - Level Gating: Inappropriate materials (e.g., Hello Kitty) excluded from early-level pools, unlocked at higher levels

  Combat Mechanics:
  - Attack dial: Timing determines damage multiplier (atkAccuracy = hit window size)
  - Defense dial: Timing determines damage reduction % (defAccuracy = block window size)
  - atkPower scales base damage, defPower scales reduction percentage
  - Enemy stats scale to player's average equipped item level

  Progression Systems:
  - Item levels: Spend gold to level up items (stats scale proportionally)
  - Vanity level: Sum of all equipped item levels (8 slots), cached and trigger-maintained
  - Player level: Separate XP-based progression tracked in PlayerProgression table
  - Enemy difficulty: Scales dynamically to player's average item level

  Economy & Progression Details:
  - Multi-currency system: GOLD (active), GEMS (reserved for IAP)
  - All currency changes tracked via EconomyTransactions ledger
  - Player progression separate from item levels (PlayerProgression table)
  - XP formula: Linear to level 50, exponential beyond (soft cap)
  - Prestige system (post-MVP): Reset to level 1, keep items, +5% gold bonus per rank
  - Gold sinks: Item upgrades, material replacement, cosmetics, loadout expansion, fast travel
  - Economy balance: ~1000-2000 gold/day income, major sinks 1000-5000 gold

  Inventory & Equipment:
  - 8 equipment slots: weapon, offhand, head, armor, feet, accessory_1, accessory_2, pet
  - Loadout system (post-MVP): Save up to 5 equipment configurations
  - Quick loadout switching for different playstyles (combat, farming, exploration)
  - Inventory filtering by slot type, sorting by level/rarity/date
  - No inventory size limit in MVP (soft cap post-MVP)

  Endgame Content (Post-MVP):
  - Combat Mastery: Defeat each enemy type 100 times
  - Collection Completion: Obtain all 26 item types and all style variants
  - Vanity Milestone: Reach vanity level 500
  - Gold Hoarder: Accumulate 100,000 gold
  - Prestige Ranks: Reach prestige level 5-10
  - Seasonal leaderboards and challenges
