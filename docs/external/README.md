### [Sora 2 (OpenAI)](./sora.md)
**Purpose:** High-quality video generation with native audio
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è No public API yet (expected late October/November 2025)

**Current Access:** iOS app and web interface only
**Pricing (via subscription):**
- Free: Limited 480p with watermarks
- ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo): 50 videos/month at 720p, 5s max
- ChatGPT Pro ($200/mo): 500 priority videos at 1080p, 20s max

**Key Features:**
- Text-to-video and image-to-video generation
- Native audio generation (dialogue, SFX, ambient)
- Up to 1080p resolution (4K planned)
- Maximum 20-second clips per generation
- 2-5 minute generation time

**Best For:** High-quality video recreation when API launches

**Important Notes:**
- US/Canada only at launch
- Manual generation required until API releases
- No batch processing or video-to-video editing
- Physics struggles with complex interactions
- Character consistency issues in multi-character scenes

**For Your Project:** Documentation includes code patterns for future API integration with webhook-based async processing patterns ready for when API launches.

## üí° Integration Patterns

### For 4-8 Second Clips (Primary Use Case)
```bash
# 1. Analyze video with Gemini
# 2. Extract audio, transcribe with ElevenLabs
# 3. Generate recreation with Replicate Veo 3
# 4. Generate audio with ElevenLabs TTS
# 5. Combine using ffmpeg
```

### For Full-Length Videos (Stitching Workflow)
```bash
# 1. Split video into 8-second segments
# 2. Analyze each segment with Gemini (parallel)
# 3. Generate each segment with Replicate (parallel/sequential)
# 4. Stitch with ffmpeg
```

### For Image-to-Video Recreation
```bash
# 1. Extract key frames from original
# 2. Generate similar images with Gemini/Imagen
# 3. Animate images with Replicate I2V models
# 4. Add audio with ElevenLabs
```

## üö® Critical Constraints

1. **Replicate webhook URLs expire after 1 hour** - Download immediately
2. **Gemini video processing is 1 FPS** - 2-hour video = 120 frames max
3. **Sora 2 has no API yet** - Manual generation only until late Oct/Nov 2025
4. **ElevenLabs free tier is 10K chars/month** - ~7-10 minutes of audio
5. **Imagen 3 requires English prompts** - Translate if needed
6. **All Gemini images have mandatory watermarks** - Cannot be disabled
