# External Library Documentation

This directory contains compressed, AI-optimized reference documentation for external libraries and frameworks used in the project.

## Purpose

External docs are generated by the `library-docs-writer` agent to:
- Extract non-obvious information (signatures, constraints, gotchas)
- Compress documentation into LLM-friendly format
- Cache latest library docs for faster context loading
- Avoid token waste on outdated or verbose official docs

## File Organization

```
external/
├── [library-name].md          # Single library reference (auto-generated)
├── [framework-name]/          # Framework with multiple related docs
│   ├── core.md               # Core concepts & API
│   ├── patterns.md           # Common patterns & idioms
│   └── gotchas.md            # Known issues & constraints
└── ...
```

## Content Guidelines

Each doc should include:

- **Quick Reference** - Function signatures, class definitions, most-used APIs
- **Key Constraints** - Version requirements, compatibility notes, breaking changes
- **Common Patterns** - Idiomatic usage examples
- **Gotchas** - Known issues, performance considerations, security concerns
- **Links** - Official docs URL for deep dives

Avoid:
- Verbose explanations (compress to essentials)
- Basic tutorials (focus on reference)
- Outdated or deprecated APIs

## Updating Docs

When a library needs updating:

```bash
/delegate @agents/library-docs-writer.md "Update [library] docs to latest version"
```

The agent will:
1. Fetch latest official docs
2. Extract non-obvious info
3. Update or create file in this directory
4. Return path to generated doc

## Usage in Implementation

When working on features using external libraries:

1. **Reference these docs first** - Faster than official docs, optimized for AI
2. **Link to official docs** - For detailed explanations, examples, tutorials
3. **Report gaps** - If critical info is missing, request agent update

## Versioning

Docs reference specific library versions. Check project dependencies:
- Backend: `mystica-express/package.json`
- Frontend: `New-Mystica/` Xcode settings
- Scripts: `scripts/package.json`

When dependencies update significantly, request doc refresh.

## Examples

- `zod.md` - Zod schema validation (TypeScript)
- `supabase-js/` - Supabase client library
- `swiftui/` - SwiftUI framework reference
- `replicate-api.md` - Replicate image generation API
