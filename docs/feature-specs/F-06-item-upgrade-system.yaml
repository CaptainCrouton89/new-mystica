title: Technical Specification - Item Upgrade System
template: ~/.claude/file-templates/init-project/feature-spec/feature-title.yaml
feature_id: F-06
status: complete
last_updated: 2025-10-23

summary: "Spend gold to increase item level. Each level increases all item stats proportionally while maintaining normalized ratios. Gold cost increases exponentially with level and scales by item rarity. Upgrading contributes to vanity level progression."

functional_overview:
  core_logic: "Player selects item and spends gold to level it up. Item level increments by 1. All stats scale by new level and rarity (base_stats × rarity_multiplier × level). Gold cost formula: base_cost × level_multiplier^(level-1). Vanity level increases based on total item levels across all items."
  data_schema: "player_items.level incremented, player.gold decremented, player.vanity_level recalculated"
  api_endpoints:
    - "POST /items/:item_id/upgrade"
    - "GET /items/:item_id/upgrade-cost"
  integration_points:
    - "Base items (F-03) receive level multiplier"
    - "Styled materials (F-04) are visual variants with normal stat effectiveness"
    - "Combat drops (F-05) provide gold for upgrades"
    - "F-09 Inventory Management (upgrade action accessible from four-action item menu)"

    - name: "users (add vanity_level)"
      columns:
        - "vanity_level: INT (derived from sum of all item levels / 6)"
        - "gold: INT (currency balance)"

    Upgrade Flow (via Inventory Four-Action Menu):
    1. Player opens inventory and browses items
    2. Player taps item card → four-action menu appears: 'Equip', 'Craft', 'Upgrade', 'Sell'
    3. Player taps 'Upgrade' option → navigates to upgrade screen
    4. Upgrade screen displays: item image with rarity border, current level, current stats, equipped badge (if applicable)
    5. Client requests GET /items/:id/upgrade-cost
    6. Server calculates cost: base_cost × level_multiplier^(level-1)
    7. Server checks player.gold >= cost
    8. Client displays upgrade preview: next level stats, gold cost, player's current gold
    9. Stat preview shows increases in green with arrows (ATK: 25 → 30 ↑)
    10. Player taps 'Upgrade' button (disabled if insufficient gold)
    11. Client sends POST /items/:id/upgrade
    12. Server validates gold, decrements gold, increments item.level
    13. Server recalculates item stats: base_stats × rarity_multiplier × new_level × base_value + material_mods
    14. Server recalculates vanity_level: sum(all_item_levels) / 6 if item is equipped
    15. Server returns updated item, gold, vanity_level
    16. Client displays upgrade-complete modal with:
        - Item image (medium, centered)
        - Level progression badge (e.g., "Level 5 → 6")
        - Stat comparison table with old/new values and delta indicators
        - Gold spent confirmation (e.g., "- 506 Gold")
        - Updated vanity level (if item is equipped)
        - "Upgrade Again" button (navigates back to upgrade preview)
        - "Return to Inventory" button (closes modal, returns to inventory)
    17. Modal presentation: Blur background, 300ms slide-up animation, semi-transparent dark overlay

    Gold Cost Formula:
    Formula: cost = base_cost × level_multiplier^(target_level - 1)

    Constants:
    - base_cost = 100 gold (cost to upgrade from level 1 → 2)
    - level_multiplier = 1.5 (exponential scaling factor)

    Examples (All Items):
    Level 1 → 2: 100 × 1.5^0 = 100 gold
    Level 2 → 3: 100 × 1.5^1 = 150 gold
    Level 3 → 4: 100 × 1.5^2 = 225 gold
    Level 5 → 6: 100 × 1.5^4 = 506 gold
    Level 10 → 11: 100 × 1.5^9 = 3,834 gold

    Vanity Level Calculation:
    Simple formula (MVP1):
    vanity_level = floor(sum_of_all_item_levels / 6)

    Example:
    6 items at level 5 each → sum = 30 → vanity = 5
    6 items at levels [10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4] → sum = 40 → vanity = 6

    Alternative (post-MVP):
    vanity_level = floor(sqrt(sum_of_all_item_levels))
    Grows slower, more meaningful progression

    Stat Scaling Formula (Updated with Rarity):
    final_stats = base_stats_normalized × rarity_multiplier × level + material_modifiers

    Constants:
    - rarity_multiplier:
      * common: 1.00
      * uncommon: 1.25
      * rare: 1.50
      * epic: 1.75
      * legendary: 2.00

    Example: Common Sword (base_stats_normalized = {atkPower: 0.5, atkAccuracy: 0.2, defPower: 0.2, defAccuracy: 0.1})

    Level 1 (common): atkPower = 0.5 × 1.00 × 1 = 0.5, total = 1.0 stat points
    Level 5 (common): atkPower = 0.5 × 1.00 × 5 = 2.5, total = 5.0 stat points
    Level 5 (legendary): atkPower = 0.5 × 2.00 × 5 = 5.0, total = 10.0 stat points

    Material Modifiers (Applied Additively):
    - Normal materials: base effectiveness
    - Styled materials: visual variants with normal stat effectiveness
    - Materials provide zero-sum stat shifts: {atkPower: +0.1, defPower: -0.1}
    - Applied as percentage: final_stat = base_stat × (1 + material_modifier_sum)

    Example with styled iron (+0.1 defPower, -0.1 atkPower at normal effectiveness):
    Styled iron modifier: +0.12 defPower, -0.12 atkPower
    Level 5 common sword: atkPower = 25 × (1 - 0.12) = 22, defPower = 10 × (1 + 0.12) = 11.2
