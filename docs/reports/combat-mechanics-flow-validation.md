- ✅ Minimal network round-trips during combat turns

## Conclusion

The combat mechanics implementation represents a sophisticated, production-ready system that closely matches the specified user flows. With 95% completion and robust architecture across all layers, the system is ready for MVP0 deployment. The remaining 5% consists entirely of polish features and post-MVP enhancements that do not impact core functionality.

The implementation demonstrates excellent separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and proper security measures. The modular design supports future enhancements while maintaining the current feature set's stability and performance.
