# Problem
problem: |
  Currently, locations on the map use generic SF Symbol icons and colored circles to represent different location types (forest, urban, desert, etc.). This provides minimal visual variety and doesn't leverage the game's AI-generated art capabilities.

  The map experience would be significantly enhanced by displaying unique, AI-generated images for each location, similar to how items and materials have custom images stored in R2.

# Solution
solution: |
  Add an `image_url` column to the Locations table that stores R2 URLs pointing to location-specific images. These images will be generated offline/manually and uploaded to the R2 bucket following the same pattern as ItemTypes base images. The frontend MapView will be updated to display these images as location markers instead of the current SF Symbol icons. The API will include image URLs in location responses, and the Swift Location model will be extended to support the new field.

# Current System
current_system:
  description: |
    **Database Layer:**
    - Locations table has: id, name, lat, lng, location_type, state_code, country_code (data-plan.yaml:657-668)
    - No image_url column currently exists
    - PostGIS spatial index for geospatial queries

    **Backend API:**
    - LocationService.ts: Handles nearby location queries
    - LocationRepository.ts: Uses RPC `get_nearby_locations` for PostGIS queries
    - GET /locations/nearby returns locations with metadata (api-contracts.yaml:1033-1066)
    - Location schema in API response does NOT include image_url (api-contracts.yaml:66-102)

    **Frontend:**
    - Location.swift model (New-Mystica/New-Mystica/Models/Location.swift:11-35)
    - MapView.swift displays locations with LocationMarkerView (MapView.swift:101-112)
    - LocationMarkerView uses SF Symbol icons based on location_type (MapView.swift:330-351)
    - No AsyncImage or URL-based image loading for locations currently

    **Image Patterns:**
    - ItemTypes have base_image_url stored in database (agent_781746.md)
    - Images uploaded to R2 bucket: `item-images/base/{item-type-id}.png`
    - ImageGenerationService handles R2 uploads (mystica-express/src/services/ImageGenerationService.ts)
    - R2 URLs constructed via `image-url.ts` utility

# Changes Required
changes_required:
  - path: "mystica-express/supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_location_image_url.sql"
    changes: |
      - CREATE migration file following naming convention: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_location_image_url.sql
      - Add ALTER TABLE locations ADD COLUMN image_url TEXT NULL
      - Set default NULL for existing rows (images will be populated later)
      - Add COMMENT on column describing R2 URL storage pattern

  - path: "mystica-express/src/types/database.types.ts"
    changes: |
      - Regenerate via `pnpm supabase:types` after migration
      - Will automatically add image_url: string | null to Locations table type

  - path: "mystica-express/src/types/api.types.ts"
    changes: |
      - Add image_url?: string to Location interface (currently lines ~66-90)
      - Follows existing pattern from ItemType interface which has base_image_url

  - path: "docs/api-contracts.yaml"
    changes: |
      - Update Location schema (lines 66-102) to include:
        ```yaml
        image_url:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          description: R2 URL to location-specific image (replaces SF Symbol icons on map)
        ```

  - path: "mystica-express/src/repositories/LocationRepository.ts"
    changes: |
      - Update SELECT queries to include image_url column
      - In findNearby() method, ensure image_url is selected from locations table
      - In findById() method, ensure image_url is returned

  - path: "mystica-express/src/services/LocationService.ts"
    changes: |
      - No changes needed - service passes through repository data
      - Verify image_url is included in response objects

  - path: "New-Mystica/New-Mystica/Models/Location.swift"
    changes: |
      - Add imageUrl: String? property to Location struct (after line 21)
      - Add imageUrl = "image_url" to CodingKeys enum (after line 33)
      - Property is optional to handle locations without images gracefully

  - path: "New-Mystica/New-Mystica/MapView.swift"
    changes: |
      - Update LocationMarkerView to accept image_url parameter
      - Replace SF Symbol icon rendering with AsyncImage when image_url is present
      - Add fallback to current SF Symbol icon if image_url is nil
      - Add circular clipping and styling to match current marker design
      - Consider adding loading/error states for AsyncImage

  - path: "scripts/populate-location-images.ts"
    changes: |
      - CREATE NEW SCRIPT following pattern from scripts/populate-item-images.ts
      - Script should:
        1. Read location types from seed data or database
        2. For each location type (forest, urban, desert, coastal, mountain, plains, swamp, arctic)
        3. Generate/fetch location-appropriate image (manual or AI-generated)
        4. Upload to R2 bucket at `location-images/{location-type}.png`
        5. Update database: UPDATE locations SET image_url = '{r2-url}' WHERE location_type = '{type}'
      - Use existing ImageGenerationService.uploadToR2() for uploads
      - Use Supabase client to update location records

      summary: "Add nullable image_url TEXT column to locations table for storing R2 URLs"

# Expected Result
expected_result:
  outcome: |
    Locations on the map will display unique, visually distinctive images instead of generic SF Symbol icons. The system will gracefully handle locations with or without images, providing fallback to the existing icon system. The implementation will follow established patterns from ItemTypes base images, using R2 for storage and optional fields for backward compatibility.

  example: |
    **Before:**
    - Map marker shows blue circle with tree.fill SF Symbol for forest locations
    - All forest locations look identical

    **After:**
    - Map marker shows actual forest image from R2 (lush trees, mystical atmosphere)
    - Each location type has distinct visual appearance
    - Fallback to SF Symbol if image not yet uploaded
    - Database query: SELECT id, name, lat, lng, location_type, image_url FROM locations
    - API response: { "id": "...", "name": "Golden Gate Park", "lat": 37.7694, "lng": -122.4862, "location_type": "forest", "image_url": "https://r2.mystica.app/location-images/forest.png" }
    - Swift model: Location(id: "...", name: "Golden Gate Park", imageUrl: "https://r2.mystica.app/location-images/forest.png")
    - MapView renders: AsyncImage(url: URL(string: location.imageUrl ?? "")) with circular clip and shadow

# Notes
notes:
  - "Image generation can be done manually or via AI - not blocking for MVP0"
  - "Consider using Midjourney/DALL-E for high-quality location type images"
  - "R2 bucket path: location-images/{location-type}.png (8 total images needed)"
  - "Script can be run offline before deployment to populate images"
  - "Future enhancement: Per-location unique images instead of per-type"
  - "AsyncImage handles caching automatically on iOS"
  - "Consider adding placeholder/loading image for better UX"
  - "Migration is backward-compatible - existing code continues to work"
