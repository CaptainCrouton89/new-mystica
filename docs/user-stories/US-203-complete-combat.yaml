acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given enemy HP reaches 0, when defeated, then show victory animation and reward screen"

  - "[ ] Given reward shown, when player taps continue, then add item/pet to inventory"
  - "[ ] Given styled enemy, when defeated, then award styled variant with visual indicator"
  - "[ ] Given player HP reaches 0, when defeated, then show loss screen with retry option"
  - "[ ] Given loss, when retry selected, then restart combat from beginning with same enemy"

context:
  why: "Victory must feel rewarding with clear feedback on what was collected. Loss should allow retry without penalty."
