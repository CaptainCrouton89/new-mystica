  as_a: "Mobile RPG Player"
  i_want: "to apply materials to my items to create enhanced variants"
  so_that: "I can customize my equipment and improve my stats"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given inventory, when player enters crafting mode, then show all items available for material application"
  - "[ ] Given crafting mode, when player selects an item, then show available materials (up to 3 per item)"
  - "[ ] Given materials selected, when player previews, then show item stats changes and new appearance preview"
  - "[ ] Given preview shown, when player confirms craft, then consume selected materials from inventory"
  - "[ ] Given craft confirmed, when processing, then generate new item image synchronously (~20 seconds)"
  - "[ ] Given image generated, when complete, then add enhanced item to inventory and remove base item"
  - "[ ] Given materials already applied, when viewing item, then show applied materials and allow further customization"

context:
  why: "Material application is the primary item customization system. Players enhance items by applying 1-3 materials to change appearance and stats."
